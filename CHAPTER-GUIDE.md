1. Source markdown files are in `OEBPS/chapters_src/`
2. Run `npm run convert:chapters` to generate files in `OEBPS/complete/`
3. The `Complete/` and `OEBPS/chapters/` directories contain manually maintained or stable versions
4. For previews, use `npm run make:canvases` to generate HTML preview files
