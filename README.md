# Chapter Conversion Tooling

This repository provides Node-based scripts to turn Markdown chapters into EPUB-ready XHTML and lightweight HTML canvases for preview.

> These tools focus on chapter internals only; front and back matter are not yet included.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Convert all chapters

```bash
npm run convert:chapters   # outputs .xhtml to OEBPS/complete/
```

## Generate canvas previews

```bash
npm run make:canvases      # outputs *_canvas.html to OEBPS/react/
```

Open any file in `OEBPS/react/` in a browser or local static server to preview the rendered chapter with the project's shared CSS.

## Where to Find Final XHTML Chapters

The final XHTML chapters are available in three main directories, each serving different purposes:

### 📁 `/Complete/` Directory
**Best for: Reading and review**
- Contains clean, well-formatted XHTML files with proper XML declarations
- Includes all 16 chapters (I through XVI) in their final form
- Features structured quiz formatting and proper HTML semantics
- Files follow the naming pattern: `[number]-Chapter-[roman]-[title]_final.xhtml`

### 📁 `/OEBPS/chapters/` Directory  
**Best for: EPUB production**
- Contains XHTML chapters optimized for EPUB packaging
- Similar content to Complete/ but with minor formatting differences
- Part of the OEBPS (Open eBook Publication Structure) standard layout

### 📁 `/OEBPS/complete/` Directory
**Best for: Generated/processed output**
- Contains processed versions with template placeholders (e.g., `{{/MasterEndnotesHTML}}`)
- Generated by the conversion tools
- May have compressed formatting and different HTML structure

### Quick Reference
```bash
# View all available final XHTML chapters
find . -name "*final.xhtml" -type f | sort

# Count total chapters
find . -name "*final.xhtml" -type f | wc -l
```

**Recommendation:** For most users looking to read or work with the final chapters, start with the `/Complete/` directory as it contains the most readable and well-structured versions.
